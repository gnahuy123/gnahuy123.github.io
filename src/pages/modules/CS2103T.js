                <p><strong>Grade: A-</strong> | <em>Year 2 Semester 1</em></p>
                <p>Learnt about software engineering. As someone who has done Orbital (without learning a lot about software engineering), I found many of the topics interesting, linking back to the work I have done.</p>
                <p>We learnt software engineering principles alongside whilst doing our projects. This allowed us to implement these practices while learning about them.</p>
                <p>The course was very well organised, with a very detailed course website and structured content. There is also a course forum which allowed us to ask queries while also learning from others' questions.</p>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Do take this with friends as half of the course is graded based on your project. My group's plan was to meet up to split work then do the work at our own pace, which I think worked well as everyone had their own schedules.</p>

                <h2>Workload: 7/10</h2>
                <p>2-3 hours of content to read through/videos to watch. The content was relatively easy to digest. The project part is effort-based so varies from person to person. There are some crunch time periods like IP week 3 or week 12 submission week where you could spend up to 3-4 full days just doing your project, so plan accordingly.</p>

                <h2>Enjoyability: 6/10</h2>
                <p>As I did Orbital in the summer, the concepts I learnt in school were more amicable and I could think about how these concepts could be applied. During the semester, we learnt bits and pieces about how software was made (1st part of planning requirements in week 2, 2nd part in week 6), which allowed us to apply concepts in our projects. During revision, it was satisfying to see all the pieces of the puzzle come together.</p>

                <h2>What Worked</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Did not fall behind 😄</li>
                    <li>I think it's quite easy to fall behind especially when the professor gives us buffers on deadlines (week 1 task due by week 3). Do learn the concepts well before moving on.</li>

                <h2>What Didn't Work</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not prepared for tutorials. I learnt the content on the weekends but my tutorial was on Thursdays, so I was not that familiar with those concepts anymore. Tutorial questions and exam questions are relatively the same style — you have to quickly recall and explain SWE concepts, so do prepare adequately to make most use of those sessions.</li>
