                <p><strong>Grade: A</strong> | <em>Year 2 Semester 1</em></p>
                <p>1st half of the semester taught probability, and the second taught basic statistics. I believe that counting was my weakest topic in CS1231S, which was repeated here, so I wanted to learn it well again.</p>
                <p>First half of the semester was 80% repeated content from A Levels. However, with more mathematical maturity from CS1231S, I studied the probability part more rigorously and tried to follow the proofs. I remember going to ask the tutor after class about certain proofs and intuitions about theorems.</p>
                <p>However, the second part of the semester was personally too rushed for me. I remember that the prof taught 3 distributions in 8 minutes which was way too fast for me to understand anything. After that topic, I just decided to practice past-year questions without understanding much.</p>
                <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Consider opting for ST2131 and ST2132 to replace ST2334 if you enjoy studying with more mathematical rigour. There are definitely tradeoffs like increased workload, but I feel a strong foundation in probability and statistics is important for certain CS specialisations.</p>

                <h2>Workload: 3/10</h2>
                <p>For H2 Math or higher takers, you could very well get away with studying 2-3 hours a week total. I found the knowledge quite interesting which is why I dug deeper.</p>

                <h2>Enjoyability: 6/10</h2>
                <p>As mentioned above, I rather preferred the first half of the course than the second. Most of it also came from my own self-study. Shoutout to my friends who discussed probability concepts with me like Bessel's correction.</p>

                <h2>What Worked</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Studying definitions and proofs in depth is useful — I believe it helped me do well in midterms. With stronger understanding of concepts came better intuition which was important during exams.</li>
                    <li>Self-study on top of material. There are a lot of high-quality videos on YouTube that explain concepts more in depth, so feel free to knock yourself out.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What Didn't Work</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inadequate final exam preparation. Unfortunately the final exam was way harder but I did miss out a few questions that were of similar format in the tutorial. Maybe I could have paced revision better to accommodate time for tutorial revision.</li>
